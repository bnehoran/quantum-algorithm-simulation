Barak N. - Independent Work Fall 2016: Simulation of Quantum Algorithms

A quantum algorithm simulation library.

The code that makes up the quantum simulator is divided into separate modules with code for working with vectors, states, operators, and registers. Each module (in its separate file) contains the relevant definitions and functions as well as varying amounts of unit testing code to verify its desired functionality.

## Getting Started

To compile and run tests:
```
make run_tests
```

## Built With

* [C        ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) - Written in the C language
* [GMP      ](https://gmplib.org/) -            For support of arbitrary precision integers
* [MakeTutor](http://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/) -    Basis of the makefile
